Instructions to Build and Package AITALK for Windows
=====================================================

1. Prerequisites
----------------
- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- Download and install NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) from:
  https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

2. Prepare the Project
----------------------
- Clone or copy the AITALK project to your Windows machine.
- Open a terminal (CMD) and navigate to the `build` directory:

  cd path\to\aitalk\windows_files\build_windows_instller_here\build

- Create a `.env` file in this directory (or in the project root) and add your Groq API key:

  Example .env file:
  ------------------
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

  (Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.)

3. Build the Windows Installer
------------------------------
- Open the NSIS application you installed earlier.
- In NSIS, go to `File > Load Script...` and select the `install.nsi` file in this folder.
- Click the 'Compile' button in NSIS.
- After compilation, the installer executable (e.g., `AITalk_Setup.exe`) will be created in the output directory specified in the script.

4. Distribute and Install
-------------------------
- You can now distribute the generated installer (`AITalk_Setup.exe`) to other Windows machines.
- On the target machine, run the installer and follow the prompts to install AITALK.
- After installation, ensure a `.env` file with your Groq API key is present in the installed directory (or set the environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY`).

5. Running AITALK
-----------------
- Open a terminal (CMD) and run `aitalk`.
